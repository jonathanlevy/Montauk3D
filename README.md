# Montauk3D

A custom application on top of SKetchfab's Viewer API. Add custom textures to a 3D object of Montauk, NY. 3D model was created in Cinema 4D and uploaded to my Sketchfab (www.sketchfab.com) account. Using the SketchfabAPIUtility (https://blog.sketchfab.com/tutorial-sketchfab-api-utility/) I created an interface that allows the user to add custom textures and take a virtual tour of the model based on Sketchfab annotation.
